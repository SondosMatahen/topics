## How to Solve Programming Problems

### Common mistakes

- The most common mistake is try to start writing code as soon as possible.
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. 
**Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.**

### Solving Problems

#### A simple set of steps

1. **Read the problem completely twice.**
-  read the problem 3 or 4 times.
- make sure you completely understand the problem. 

2. **Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.**
- It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate.
-  solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution 
- use a Mathematical Induction approach if possible .

3. **Optimize the manual steps.**
- What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. **Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.**
- What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

5. **Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.**
- All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

6. **Optimize the real code.**
- This is a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.

- “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor, It’s a Sign of Weakness.
>- Your time is not unlike your paycheck, if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
- “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”
>- When you’re busy, you are on **autopilot**. You can’t see the hours slipping away, time you’ll never get back.
- Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy.
>- For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.
- The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.
>- Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.
- most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.

## How to think like a programmer

“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.”

 ### what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

 - Here are the steps:

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Stuck ??
5. Practice

## 5 Why & 5 How

- The 5 Why method is simply asking the question “Why” enough times until you get past all the symptoms of a problem and down to the root cause. 

- The 5 Hows are then used to determine a root or permanent solution to the “root cause (s)” of the problem .

- The team will review “Why” did the problem occur and “How” can it be resolved so it does not occur again.

### How to Perform 5 Why & 5 How

1. Form the Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask Why
4. Determine and Implement Corrective Actions
